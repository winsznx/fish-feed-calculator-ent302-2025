## 📐 Calculation Method

The calculator follows the **standard Pearson Square methodology**:

1. **Mean Calculation** – Average of protein and energy sources (FM, SBM, GNC, YM, RB, Maize)
2. **Pearson Square** – Determines optimal ratios based on target crude protein (CP)
3. **Proportional Distribution** – Allocates ingredients by protein contribution
4. **Weight Calculation** – Converts ratios to actual weights
5. **Cost Analysis** – Computes total formulation cost


## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

**Step 1: Ingredient Information**

* Select protein sources (Fish Meal, Soybean Meal, Groundnut Cake)
* Select energy sources (Yellow Maize, Rice Bran, Maize)
* Enter protein percentages and cost per kg

**Step 2: Fixed Ingredients**

* Set total fixed ingredients percentage
* Optional: Add premix, methionine, lysine, etc.

**Step 3: Feed Requirements**

* Input required crude protein (CP) percentage
* Enter desired feed weight

**Step 4: View Calculations**

* Pearson Square visualization
* Calculated ratios and percentages

**Step 5: Results & Export**

* Comprehensive ingredient breakdown
* Switch units (kg ↔ g)
* Export results as CSV
