Calculation Method
The calculator follows the standard Pearson Square methodology:
	1	Mean Calculation: Averages protein sources (FM, SBM, GNC) and energy sources (YM, RB, Maize)
	2	Pearson Square: Determines optimal ratios based on required crude protein (CP)
	3	Proportional Distribution: Allocates ingredients based on their protein contributions
	4	Weight Calculation: Converts percentages to actual weights
	5	Cost Analysis: Calculates total formulation cost
How to Use
Step 1: Ingredient Information
	â€¢	Select protein sources (Fish Meal, Soya Bean Meal, Groundnut Cake)
	â€¢	Select energy sources (Yellow Maize, Rice Bran, Maize)
	â€¢	Enter protein percentages and costs per kg
Step 2: Fixed Ingredients
	â€¢	Set total fixed ingredients percentage
	â€¢	Optional: Break down individual components (Premix, Methionine, Lysine, etc.)
Step 3: Feed Requirements
	â€¢	Enter required Crude Protein (CP) percentage
	â€¢	Set total feed weight needed
Step 4: View Calculations
	â€¢	See Pearson Square visualization
	â€¢	Review calculated ratios and percentages
Step 5: Results & Export
	â€¢	View comprehensive ingredient breakdown
	â€¢	Switch between kg/gram units
	â€¢	Export results to CSV
Technical Stack
	â€¢	Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
